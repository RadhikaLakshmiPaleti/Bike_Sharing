## General Information
- A US based bike sharing provider company has undergone a dip due to corona pandemic. To recover from that situation, they would like to understand the various factors influencing the demand for bike-sharing and prepare for the market requirements
- The main aim of this project is find the various factors that influence the demand for bike-sharing and build a linear regression model to predict the demand
- Data is being collected by the service provider for demand of shared bikes based on various metreological surveys and people's styles across the American market


## Conclusions
- According to the observations, found that the demand for the bikes is increasing in the coming years
- Demand on the bikes depends on the season as it might be more comfortable to use bikes in summer than in winter
- Demand of the bikes depends on the weather situation like demand is more when sky is clear and less when it is rainy or thunderstorms are expected
